        <strong> Private Swim Lessons </strong><br />
        Our <a href="...">private swim lessons</a> provide one-on-one instruction for students ages
        three months through adult. Private swim lessons are the best option for accelerated
        learning. Each lesson will allow our instructors to build on the momentum and skills taught
        in the previous lesson with minimal downtime. From the basics of putting your face into the
        water to refining your stroke technique, private lessons will offer the highest rate of
        progress. <br /><a href="...">Learn more here!</a>

        <strong>Swim Lessons</strong><br />
        At Splashes, our <a href="...">semi-private swim lessons</a> offer students ages 2.5 to 13
        the opportunity to interact with another student of a similar age and ability while still
        receiving personal attention. Whether you would like us to pair your child with another
        student of similar age and ability or would like to take lessons with a friend or sibling,
        our semi-private lessons are a cost effective option. Students also have the opportunity to
        observe one another in the lesson. <br /><a href="...">Learn more here!</a>

        “Daddy and Me” classes) gives parents the opportunity to be hands-on with their little one
        while our instructors facilitate the learning process between you and your child. These
        lessons provide a fun and relaxed environment for you and your child in the water. Children
        ages 3 months through 3 years of age can participate. However, we encourage children ages

        Splashes <a href="...">Stroke Clinics</a> give students the opportunity to advance their
        swimming techniques while in a group setting. Our Stroke Clinic classes place emphasis on
        proper technique over speed and prepare students for swim team. Swimmers ages 5 and older
        who are level 8 or higher can benefit from participating in these 40 minute classes. A
        strong technical foundation will ensure that students’ progress much faster when the time
        comes for them to work on speed. Our stroke clinics are exciting and fast paced, where each
        student will receive a great workout. <br /><a href="...">Learn more here!</a>
